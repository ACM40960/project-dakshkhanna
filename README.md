The aim of this project is to develop a Face Mask Detection/Recognition System 
that, amidst the global pandemic, helps in  detecting whether a person is wearing a 
face mask or not that can help in multiple ways including, entrance to any hospital, 
students in schools, etc.

The detection system uses Python Programming with Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Keras and
OpenCV.

This is a 2-Step system, namely, Training and detection, where, the program is first trained, 
and then the trained program using OpenCV, uses the in-built Webcam to Live-Test/detect whether 
a person is wearing a mask or not.
